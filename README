I was looking for a TUI login screen which works with PAM (i.e. the fingerprint sensor on my laptop)
It turns out that most of them just assume the user uses password to login.

So I made this little piece of login screen for myself, 

Since it's damn simple, no command line arguments, no config files, and no dependencies!

Just modify the code to meet your needs and recompile, like what you would do with dwm(1).

hopefully this is useful for you, enjoy!
